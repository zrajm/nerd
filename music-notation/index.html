  <h1>Some Advice on Writing Sheet Music</h1>
  <h2>By <i>zrajm</i></h2>

<div role="main" itemprop="mainContentOfPage">

  <p>I am by no means a professional when it comes to typesetting music, but I
    have dabbled a bit with it
    using <a href="http://lilypond.org/">Lilypond</a> (sometimes
    writing <a href="http://klingonska.org/songs/anthem/">a Klingon song</a>
    or <a href="http://klingonska.org/songs/tahjaj_wo/">two</a>, sometimes
    doing <a href="http://zrajm.org/songs/">choir music</a>).

<p>I’ve found that remembering all the conventions of music typesetting
  is <i>hard,</i> so here I’ve tried to collect some of the wisdoms I’ve
  encountered. – This stuff should be general enough to be used with any kind
  of score producing software.

  <p>Some good advice for typesetting music:

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(music)">beam</a>
  <dd>Beams are thick lines that are used connect consecutive notes (well,
    eighths and shorter notes). They are used instead of the
    note <em>flag.</em>

    <p>Notes for singing traditionally only use beams when a single syllable is
    held over more than one note (and even then the beam is broken at the main
    beats in the bar). But newer practices advocate using beams in vocal music
    in the same manner as other music.
    (See: <a href="http://forums.cpdl.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=5375">Beaming
    of notes in Choral Music</a>)

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotchet">crotchet</a>
  <dd>Also called <em>quarter</em> or <em>quarter note.</em>

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_(note)">flag</a>
  <dd><img style="float:right;" src="parts-of-note.png"> A little wavey thing
    at the end of the note <em>stem</em>, indicating that a note is
    an <em>eighth</em> or shorter. A flag may be replaced by a <em>beam</em>
    which connect the note to a neigboring note.

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(music)#Grand_staff">grand staff</a>
  <dd><img style="float:right;" src="grand-staff.png" height=164 width=220>Two
    (or more) staves joined by a brace, or intended to be played at once by a
    single performer (usually a keyboard instrument or the harp), make up
    a <i>great stave</i> (BrE) or <i>grand staff</i> (AmE). The upper staff
    usually have a treble clef and the lower staff has a bass clef (in this
    instance, middle C is centered between the two staves, and it can be
    written on the first ledger line below the upper staff or the first ledger
    line above the lower staff). When playing the piano or harp, the upper
    staff is normally played with the right hand and the lower staff with the
    left hand. When written for the organ, a grand staff comprises three
    staves, one for each hand on the manuals and one for the feet on the
    pedalboard.

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics">lyrics</a> (låttext)
  <dd>(This is my guess, based on looking at lyrics in other peoples notes
    rather than something I’ve found concrete advice on.) Lyrics should be
    written with a full set of punctuation marks when written in musical scores
    (e.g. using a period at the end of each sentence). – Sometimes (in poetry
    and lyrics written without any musical score) periods and commas are left
    off (or implied by the line breaks), but since line breaks are wholly
    determined by the music these clues are not available in sheet music.

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(music)">minim</a>
  <dd>Also called <em>half note.</em>

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaver">quaver</a>
  <dd>Also called <em>eighth</em> or <em>eighth note.</em>

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_(music)">rest</a>
  <dd>A brief pause in the music.

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiquaver">semiquaver</a>
  <dd>Also called <em>sixteenth</em> or <em>sixteenth note</em>. This note
    has two <em>flags</em> or <em>beams.</em>

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(music)">staff</a>
  <dd>Five horizontal <i>lines</i> and four <i>spaces</i> that each represent a
    different musical pitch or different percussion instruments. Lines and
    spaces are numbered from bottom to top; bottom line is the <i>first
    line</i> and the top line is the <i>fifth line.</i>

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_(music)">stem</a>
  <dd>A vertical line connected to the <em>note head</em> of half notes, and
    all notes of shorter duration.

  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upbeat#Upbeat">upbeat</a>
  <dd>Also called <em>anacrusis.</em> A partial unaccented measure that occurs
    before the first whole measure of a piece. Traditionally, if there is an
    upbeat, then the last measure of the same piece is shorter (so that the
    entire piece contains a whole number of measures).

    <p>When more than one voice is used, only some of which have upbeats, then
    upbeats are written for all the voices (and filled with <em>rests</em> for
    those voices where the upbeat is not played).
