<P><EM>The plural of <STRONG><FONT

COLOR=#DD3615>porghmey</STRONG></FONT> (and that of <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>lom</STRONG></FONT>, <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>lommey</STRONG></FONT>); most likely, <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­Du'</STRONG></FONT> is used only for body parts, not
the body itself.</EM> <FONT SIZE=-1>[KLI: R. Stewart, 11/16/97, "Re:
KLBC tlhIngan yot 'ay' cha'DIch"; KLI: R. Stewart, 11/26/96, "Re:
KLBC Plurals"]</FONT>


<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR>
<TD>There is evidently some latitude in the grey areas. MO tells us
on the MSN forum that <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>DIr</FONT></STRONG> has the plurals <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>DIrDu'</FONT></STRONG> and <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>DIrmey</FONT></STRONG> depending on whether it is
still on the animal, or off of it. (Does this mean that, if I serve
my guests Pipius Claw and each one gets several, I would refer to
them as <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>pachmey</FONT></STRONG>?).
However, in KGT, he describes the handles of a type of pot as
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>DeSDu'</FONT></STRONG>, although they
were obviously never alive at all!

<BR>     My theory is that Klingons are deeply interested in whether a
body part is still attached to its body and alive <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­Du'</FONT></STRONG>, or detatched and dead
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­mey</FONT></STRONG>. Their interest in
the bodies themselves is different, where their only concern is
whether it is a person <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­pu'</FONT></STRONG> or a non­person <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­mey</FONT></STRONG>. In the case of inanimate
objects, their interest in body parts causes the Klingons to confer
"honorary" status as a body part on objects that resemble them;
these objects receive the <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­Du'</FONT></STRONG> suffix to make the identification
clear.

<BR>     This could also be the origin of the "scattered around" meaning
of <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­mey</FONT></STRONG>. When a body
part is separated from its body, its plural changes from
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Du'</FONT></STRONG> to <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­mey</FONT></STRONG>, and separation could come to
imply not merely removal but dispersal; eventually this "dispersal"
meaning could be generalized to words whose usual plural is
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­pu'</FONT></STRONG>.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><STRONG>A "being capable of using language" must be a true living

inherent capacity for speech (which may not be manifested, in the

<DL><DD><OL>

<P><LI><STRONG><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</STRONG></FONT> and
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­vo'</STRONG></FONT> are strictly
locative; they refer only to <u>motion</U>, or <u>location</U>. They
can't be used in other situations in which English uses "to", "in"
or "from" in a metaphorical sense (eg. "I translate from English to
Klingon"; you can't use <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</STRONG></FONT> for "to" or <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­vo'</STRONG></FONT> for "from").</STRONG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[HQ8:1 p.7]</FONT>

<P><LI><STRONG>Some prepositional concepts in English are verbs in
Klingon: eg. <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>tlhej</STRONG></FONT> for
"with", both in the sense of "accompanying" and "doing something
together with", eg. <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>Dargh vItlhutlh 'ej
mutlhej torgh</STRONG></FONT> "Torg drinks tea with me."</STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=-1>[HQ2:4 p.18]</FONT>.

<P><LI><EM>It seems that a noun with a Type 5 suffix can modify a
single noun (as opposed to whole sentences), eg. <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>ghe''orDaq luSpet</STRONG></FONT> "a black hole in the
Netherworld".</EM> <FONT SIZE=-1>[PK; BoP]</FONT>


<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR>
<TD>As has been pointed out <FONT SIZE=-1>[HQ6:2 p.2]</FONT>, this construction is most
likely not an example of the N­N pattern, but a contraction of
something involving a <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­bogh</FONT></STRONG>
verb: <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>balDaq chenmoHlu'bogh
Duj</FONT></STRONG> <EM>ship (which someone assembled) in a
bottle</EM>. But, since they functionally act the same way, the
point is probably moot.

<BR>     We usually call this the "Cat­In­The­Hat" problem;
ironically, it doesn't really apply to this situation. "In the hat"
doesn't mean the Cat is sitting inside a hat, rather, it's an
English idiom for "wearing a hat" and would probably be translated
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>mIv tuQtaHbogh
vIghro'</FONT></STRONG>.</TD></TR></TABLE> 


<P><LI><STRONG>Verbs of motion have different meanings when used
with and without <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</STRONG></FONT>
and object prefixes:


<BR>        <UL>
          <LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X(­Daq) vI­Y</STRONG></FONT> "I Y to X" (<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</STRONG></FONT> is optional); 
          <LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X­vo' vI­Y</STRONG></FONT> "I Y away from X"; 
          <LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X­Daq
          jI­Y</STRONG></FONT> "I Y at/on/in X".</STRONG>
<BR>     <FONT SIZE=-1>[HQ7:4 p.8]</FONT></UL>


<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR>
<TD>This is a restricted and special usage, and should not be
overused or generalized to other types of verbs or noun phrases.
I've been trying to explain the new rules to myself:

<DL>

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X(­Daq) vI­Y</FONT></STRONG> 

<DD>The ground­work for this phrase was actually laid in TKD,
where MO says that <STRONG>"There are a few verbs whose meanings
include locative notions, such as 
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>ghoS</FONT></STRONG> <EM>approach, proceed</EM>.
The locative suffix need not be used on nouns which are the
objects of such verbs."</STRONG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[TKD p.28]</FONT> Maybe this means the rule is now extended
to all verbs of motion, that whenever a verb of motion has an object, 
motion toward that object is assumed.  The 
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</FONT></STRONG>, we're told, is
optional, and I'm guessing is an ungrammatical usage, like leaving
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>lu­</FONT></STRONG> off of plural 
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­lu'</FONT></STRONG> objects or using double negatives in English:
people are known to do it, but it's also recognized as "wrong".  I
wouldn't take it to mean that nouns with Type 5 suffixes can be
used as direct objects in general.

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X­vo' vI­Y</FONT></STRONG>

<DD>Except for this one, of course. This does fly in the face of
everything we thought we knew about direct objects and Type 5 noun
suffixes. All I can guess is that this is some special usage
peculiar to <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­vo'</FONT></STRONG> used
with motion verbs. At least, if we want to say <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>X­vo' Y vIjaH</FONT></STRONG> "I go from X to Y", we
can still use the same verb prefix! But what, if anything does
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X­vo' jI­Y</FONT></STRONG> now mean? "At
a distance from X, I am Y­ing"?

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>X­Daq jI­Y</FONT></STRONG>

<DD>The grammar of this isn't new, the only innovation is that it is
now restricted to mean <u>only</U> some type of movement Y occuring
at place X.

</DL>

<P>So, maybe the new rules in essence are

<OL>

<P><LI>To indicate motion, use a motion verb with a direct object.

  <OL>
    <LI>Motion towards is the default and needs no marker.
    <LI>Motion away from needs the marker <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­vo'</FONT></STRONG>.
  </OL>

<P><LI>To indicate location, use a motion verb (or any verb) with a "no
object" verb prefix.

  <OL> 
   <LI>Use <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</FONT></STRONG> for action occuring at the point of reference.
   <LI>Use <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­vo'</FONT></STRONG> for action occuring at a remove from the point of reference.
  </OL>

</OL>

<P>If these are correct, then the new rules have actually given us a
pretty neat new set of tools. It doesn't change our understanding of
locative phrases, but adds a way to refine the meanings we can
express with <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</FONT></STRONG> and
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>­vo'</FONT></STRONG>.

<BR>     An unanswered question is how to use those words which, MO
tells us in TKD, never require <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>­Daq</FONT></STRONG>, such as <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>naDev</FONT></STRONG> or <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>Dat</FONT></STRONG>. They fit fine in the first
example: <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>naDev vIghoS</FONT></STRONG> "I
am coming here", but what about the other uses? We've encountered
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>naDevvo'</FONT></STRONG> on the PK tape,
and it's probably still OK, but how would you say "I walk in (i.e.
while being) here": ?<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>naDev
jIyIt</FONT></STRONG> or ?<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>naDevDaq
jIyIt</FONT></STRONG>?

<BR>     The observant student will note that some of the examples
in TKD and elsewhere don't agree with these new rules. One guiding
principle of the KLI is that the newest rule is generally the most
correct, so the old examples should be considered superceded.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3><A NAME="3.4">3.4. The noun­noun construction</A></H3>

<DL><DD><OL>

<P><LI>This construction doesn't just show possession, but is also used
as the grammatical Genitive. That is, it forms phrases that are
equivalent to English adjectives of origin <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>romuluS HIq</STRONG></FONT>, composition <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>peQ chem</STRONG></FONT>, or location <STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>tlhIngan wo'</STRONG></FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-1>[HQ3:3 p.6]</FONT>


<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR>
<TD>I have long believed that the underlying logic of the N1­N2
construction is that the set of items specified by N2 is restricted
to a subset specified by N1. This explains not only the possessive
use (<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>yaS taj</FONT></STRONG> "the
officer's knife" = "of the universal set of knives, the one which is
the officer's"), but also the Genitive (<STRONG><FONT
COLOR=#DD3615>peQ chem</FONT></STRONG> "magnetic field" = "of the
universal set of fields, the one pertaining to magnetism").</TD></TR></TABLE> 

<P><LI>Multiple N­N­N(­N...) formations are allowed. eg.
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>SuvwI' qa' patlh</STRONG></FONT> "a
warrior's level of spiritual attainment" <FONT SIZE=-1>[S33]</FONT>

<P><LI>Noun apposition, different from the N­N construction, is
allowed, eg. <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>DuraS be'nI'pu' be'etor
lurSa' je</STRONG></FONT> "Duras's sisters, Betor and Lursa" <FONT
SIZE=-1>[S26; HQ3:1 p.5]</FONT>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR>
<TD>The difference between N­N possession and apposition is that in the
former, the more general term comes last, preceded by the more
specific, while in the latter, the more general term comes first.
Also, in the former, the two nouns combine to form a new concept,
while in the latter, the two nouns (or phrases) both refer to
different aspects of the same concept (that is, "Duras's sisters"
and "Betor and Lursa" both refer to the same persons).</TD></TR></TABLE> 

<P><LI>Nouns representing locative prepositional concepts, such as
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>retlh, bIng, botlh</STRONG></FONT>,
